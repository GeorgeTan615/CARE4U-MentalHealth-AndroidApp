1) How to get our submission to run

Since our proposed idea is an application, the software we would be using for this submission is Android Studio, which consists of code in Java programming language.
To run our submission, just download the submission zip file, extract the file inside and locate the file in Android Studio. After that, click the green play button on the top bar, it will then launch the application through the device emulator, or which device you have connected it to. The device/emulator should be running Android 10.0 with an API level of 29. After the app has launched, you can just treat it as a normal application which you have downloaded on your device, and navigate through it. Do note that this is just a prototype and some features are not fully developed. Enjoy!

2) Theme Selected
The theme selected for this submission is MENTAL HEALTH.

3) Project background (purpose, users, use)
Purpose:
The purpose of the CARE4U project is to provide help to mental health patients, increase awareness of mental health issues and build a community for mentally ill patients. 

Target Users:
The targeted users would be mental health patients as well as people that wish to make an impact and contribute back to society.

Features:
For non-patient users, they can apply as a volunteer in the application which will provide services such as counseling. Users are also able to click on the volunteer guidelines to have a better idea of the criterias and expectations of being a volunteer. After applying to be a volunteer, users can also click on the application status button to check if their application has been approved or is still processing. 

These non-patient users can also navigate to the diagnostic tool if they suspect that they developed any mental disorder. Users will also get to experience the life of a mental health patient with certain mental disorders through the DISORPERIENCE feature, which uses augmented reality. For example, if a user wishes to experience a Schizophrenic hallucination to better understand Schizophrenia, this application would use the camera function after asking for the user's permission, it would then filter the surroundings such that it reflects the actual visual of the mental health patient with that mental disorder. 
In this way, the user will get to experience a combination of hallucinations, delusions which makes them understand the mental health patient better, and this increases the awareness of mental health disorders. This is just one of the CARE4U features covered amongst others that help educate users on mental health.

For mental health patients who use the app, we consider the feelings of patients and understand they at times may feel embarrassed or shy to seek help from their loved ones. In our app, we provide the CHAT WITH CHAD feature where patients will get connected to a random qualified volunteer who has passed their volunteer assessment.
Not just that, if the user wishes to help the mental health patients that are facing financial difficulties, they can head to the DONATION TABUNG page and donate. The donation page provides details on who they are donating to, which serves as evidence that the transaction was secure and not falsely paid to an unverified organization or campaign. Other than that, users can claim a downloadable e-certificate after they have donated as well. This will be a token of appreciation from CARE4U for their kindness and sincerity.

Other than that, users can head to the TABUNG DETAILS page under the Donation Tabung page to check out the full details of all the donations from users to CARE4U. The information shown such as the current savings, number of contributors, number of patients benefited and the memory lane will be constantly updated every day so that users will be kept updated on how much money has CARE4U collected, how many people have contributed, how many people were benefited and also what has the money from donations have been spent on recently. This page would be mainly used to maintain transparency between CARE4U and our users so that users will be able to know the in and out details of CARE4Uâ€™s operations.

To ensure that everyone gets an equal career opportunity, we understand that it may be harder for mental health patients to seek a job, hence we came up with CAREER CLOUD, a career opportunity page that has partnered with companies with jobs and programs that provide benefits for mentally-ill patients. Our app also provides educational programs
for youths that need special education guidance. It will be tailored towards their interests and strengths. 

A fun feature of this app is having daily fun challenges for the patient, this will help them exercise their brain by giving out challenging puzzles or activities. There is also a game section where the user can play games that help relax their mind.

Lastly, we also wish to create a community from this app, hence mental-health patients can apply for and join an online support group to mingle with patients with a similar disorder, age group, or location.
